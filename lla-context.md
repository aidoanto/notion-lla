A cloud communications platform as a service (CPaaS) that allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs. Used in CISS Tools.

## CDN (Content Delivery Network)

- **Service Mentioned:** Azure Front Door
- **What it is:** A CDN is a global network of servers that stores copies (a "cache") of your website's content, like images, videos, and stylesheets.
- **Its Relevance to Your Project:** When someone visits the Lifeline website, the CDN delivers the content from a server that is geographically closest to them. Someone in Perth will get content from a server in or near Perth, not from the main server which might be in Sydney.
**Speed!** This is a huge factor for user experience and SEO. A faster-loading site keeps users engaged (which is critical for Lifeline's visitors) and is favoured by search engines like Google. This ensures content uploaded to Drupal is distributed globally via the CDN for fast loading.

## WAF (Web Application Firewall)

- **Service Mentioned:** Azure Front Door WAF
- **What it is:** Think of a WAF as a specialised security guard for the website. It sits between your users and the website, inspecting all the traffic and blocking malicious requests, like common hacking attempts (the doc mentions XSS and SQL Injection).
- **Its Relevance to Your Project:** It provides a critical layer of security to protect the Drupal application, its data, and your users.
Peace of mind. It works silently in the background to protect the platform from being defaced, compromised, or having user data stolen. It's a key part of maintaining the trust your users have in Lifeline.

## Load Balancing

- **Service Mentioned:** Azure Application Gateway
- **What it is:** Imagine a busy supermarket with only one checkout open – the queue would be huge. Load balancing is like opening up multiple checkouts and having a manager direct shoppers to the next available one. It distributes incoming website traffic across multiple servers so that no single server gets overloaded.
- **Its Relevance to Your Project:** It ensures the Lifeline site remains available and responsive, even during sudden traffic spikes (e.g., if a major news event or awareness campaign drives a lot of visitors).
**Uptime and Reliability.** This is what keeps the site from crashing under pressure. The document also mentions "sticky sessions," which is important. It ensures that if a user is in the middle of a process (like filling out a form), they stay connected to the _same server_, so they don't lose their progress. This is vital for a good user experience.

## Application (The "Engine Room")

- **Services Mentioned:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

**What it is:** This is where the Drupal website software actually lives and runs.

- **AKS** is a modern, powerful system that runs applications in "containers." Think of a container as a neat little box with everything the application needs to run. The best part is that it can automatically create more boxes (this is "autoscaling") when traffic is high and remove them when it's quiet.
- A **VM** is essentially a complete computer, but it exists as software on a physical server in an Azure data centre.

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** This is the core hosting environment. AKS is being used because it's highly scalable and resilient.

## Azure Database for MySQL

This is the website's organised digital filing cabinet. All of your content—every webpage, article, user comment, form submission, and user account—is stored in the database. MySQL is a very popular and robust database technology.

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** It's the structured heart of the Drupal CMS. When you create a new page in Drupal and hit "publish," all that text and data gets saved into this database.

## Bitbucket Pipelines

This is an automated process for developers (at Bliss) to release updates to the website.

- **CI (Integration):** When a developer makes a change, it's automatically tested to make sure it doesn't break anything.
- **CD (Deployment):** If all the tests pass, the changes can be automatically rolled out to the live website.

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** This is the assembly line that takes new features and bug fixes from the developer's computer to the live Lifeline website.

## Azure AD (Active Directory) & RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**What it is:** This is the system that controls who can log in and what they are allowed to do. **RBAC** means giving people permissions based on their job (their "role").

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** It will define who from Lifeline (like you) and Bliss has access to the different parts of the new infrastructure and the Drupal CMS.

## Domain Management

### Cloudflare (Managed by Lifeline)

This refers to the management of your website's domain name (e.g., `lifeline.org.au`). Cloudflare is a service that sits in front of your entire infrastructure and helps manage how internet traffic finds and connects to your website.

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** It's the official address for the Lifeline website. Cloudflare provides an extra layer of performance and security even before traffic gets to the Azure services.

## Storage

### Azure Files

**What it is:** This is different from the database. If the database is the "filing cabinet" for your content _text_, think of Azure Files as the "media library" or "storage room." It's where all the files you upload are kept.

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** When you are in the Drupal CMS and upload an image for a blog post, a PDF resource, or a video file, that file gets stored in Azure Files.

## Logging

### Azure Monitor + Log Analytics

**What it is:** Think of this as the website's "black box flight recorder." It automatically records everything that happens on the server: errors, security events, traffic spikes, performance issues, etc.

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** It provides the raw data that developers and system administrators (at Bliss and Lifeline) use to monitor the health of the website and diagnose problems.

## Backup

### Azure Backup

This is the ultimate safety net. A backup is a complete copy (a snapshot) of the entire system—the database, the storage files, the application code, everything—taken at a specific point in time.

**Its Relevance to Your Project:** The document recommends daily backups. This means that in the event of a major disaster (e.g., a critical server failure, a major security breach, or even a large accidental deletion of content), the team can restore the entire website to how it was on the previous day.
